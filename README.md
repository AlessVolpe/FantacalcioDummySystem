# Fantacalcio Dummy System
### _The game that took Italy by the heel revolutionized_

[![Java 21 CI with Maven](https://github.com/Syro98/FantacalcioDummySystem/actions/workflows/maven.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Syro98/FantacalcioDummySystem/actions/workflows/maven.yml)

Fantacalcio Dummy System, named in reference to *Neon Genesis Evangelion*'s
Entry Plug Dummy System, it's a simulation of Italy's favorite Fantasy Football game. 

## The vision
A way to play with friends or to keep track of a league going on in real life. 
But the vision doesn't stop at simulation, while it could have been enough, 
I couldn't settle for it. Fantacalcio Dummy System will integrate a complex
statistical analysis system to understand really how much luck and the sequence 
in which matches are played come into play.

## Technologies
- [Java 21](https://www.java.com/) - Powerful and omnipresent object-oriented programming language
- [Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) - Probably one of the most used Java project management tools
- [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org) - Lightweight but fully-featured SQL database engine
